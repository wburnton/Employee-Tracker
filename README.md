## Description  

This is an employee tracker that uses inquirer and SQL to create a database for add and updating employees and their roles, departments, and salaries. I ended up getting quite stuck doing this assignment and thus I am turning it in late. Figuring it out did lend it self to me figuring out how SQL works though.

## Usage  

Run "npm i", then run "node server.js" in the terminal. Use the arrow keys to click on the option you want.
